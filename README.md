### I'm Steel! or, Abraxas!

I'm a developer who prefers to work alone on things. Why? Working with others is kinda horrible imo, it does nothing but absolutely ruin my workflow and slow me wayyy down. Plus conflicting code styles is just a headache to work with.

I use:
* C# (For games, as I prefer using Unity for game development)
* Java
* Kotlin (I prefer KT over Java)

I dislike (my OPINION):
* JavaScript (JS - absolutely disgusting.)
* HTML (I just hate web development related things tbvh)
* C/C++ (Just meh imo)

I do know some other languages (kinda) but I prefer the ones listed above.

You MAY commission me (though I will not work for free), but I will most likely deny if it's out of my comfort zone (mainly if it's working with something I dislike/don't know, or a language I dislike/don't know)
